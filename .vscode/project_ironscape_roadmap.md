# üó∫Ô∏è Game Development Roadmap: Project Ironscape

A prioritized roadmap for implementing core features, systems, and polish, based on my game design vision.

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Core Foundation (High Impact, Low Complexity)

These will clean up existing systems and lay the groundwork for future polish.

1. **Refactor weapon attacks to depend on equipped weapon**
2. **Add hover text and examine feature**
3. **Display tooltips for equipment bonuses**
4. **Reorganize the skills list visually**
5. **Skills panel:**
   - Show `EXP: ___`, `EXP to LVL: ___`
   - Display `Total Level` (sum of all skills)
6. **Adjust inventory layout to better center tabs visually**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 2: Basic Combat & Inventory Polish

7. **Implement accuracy vs. avoidance (attack rolls)**
8. **Add hitsplats and damage numbers** Damage calculates like WoW (e.g, 20-25 dmg on weapon)
8.5 **Blocking system? 
9. **Implement basic spells (E for damage, Q for heal)**
9.5 Dodge system (double tap w or s to roll). Dodging gives iFrames. 
10. **Add drag and drop within inventory**
11. **Right-click menu on inventory items (use, drop, examine)**
12. **Expand item diversity:**
    - Add more weapons, armor, consumables
    - Begin developing unique/pixel art for core items

17. **Display full equipment stats in Equipment tab:**
    - Accuracy, Strength, Defense, Magic
    - Bonus resistances: Burn, Poison, Stun, Blind, etc.
